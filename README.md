If you run the test2.py file, you must be click on one domain and the are extract all off the element you request.

the différence between there 2 files is for the 2xtend.py,   i add "section= domain.text" and "print(Domain : , section)"
it is  the only différence.
but run both

i want to extract all the respons on a table on google sheet.
